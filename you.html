    <h2 class="sorry"> I have been thinking a lot about our past â€“ what it was, how it couldâ€™ve been, and where we are right now, and the only thing I can say is â€“ I am wholeheartedly sorry.
<br>I knew since that very first kiss, every kiss with you felt like the first from that day forward, and I didnâ€™t know how to value that at the time</h2>
<span>I'm sorry you gave it so much of your time, your vibrant emotions, and your affection. While you embraced me with an open heart, I am sorry that I became desensitized to my emotions for you and your love. I am not sure how I was able to do that. I'm not sure how I managed to maintain a cool heart when I was internally sweltering. As if my heart's interior had been fiercely pumping away while the exterior had been immediately frozen by liquid nitrogen, fighting for us. It sometimes seems to me that it still does. After long it would be a lie for me to say that old emotions donâ€™t come back to me when I think of you and us.</span>
